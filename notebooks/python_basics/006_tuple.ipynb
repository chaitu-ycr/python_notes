They are similar to lists in some ways, but with a key difference: tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.\n","- Tuples are enclosed in parentheses `()`, similar to lists, but commas are optional to separate items if you have just one or two elements.\n","- Just like lists, elements in tuples are indexed starting from 0. You can access them using their index within square brackets.\n","- Negative indexing works the same way as with lists.\n","- Similar to lists, you can extract a portion of a tuple using slicing with square brackets and colons\n","- The slicing syntax ([start:end:step]) functions the same way as for lists.\n","- Unlike lists, tuples are immutable. This means you cannot modify elements after creating the tuple. Here's an attempt that will result in an error.\n","- Common Tuple Operations\n","    - `len(tuple)`: Returns the length (number of items) in the tuple.\n","    - `in` and `not in`: Check if an element is present in the tuple.\n","    - `tuple(iterable)`: Can be used to convert other iterables (like lists) to tuples, but be aware that modifications to the original list won't be reflected in the tuple.\n","- When to Use Tuples\n","    - Use tuples when you need a collection of items that should not be changed after creation. This helps prevent accidental modifications and ensures data integrity.\n","    - Tuples are often used to represent fixed data sets or to store configuration values.\n","    - They can also be used as dictionary keys since they are immutable and hashable (meaning they can be used as dictionary keys).\n","- Key Points\n","    - Tuples are ordered collections of elements.\n","    - They are immutable, offering data integrity by preventing accidental changes.\n","    - Accessing and slicing elements work similarly to lists.\n","    - Tuples are useful for representing fixed data sets or configuration values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["fruits = (\"üçé\", \"üçå\", \"üçí\")  # With commas\n","numbers = (1, 2, 3)  # Without commas (for single-line tuples)\n","\n","first_fruit = fruits[0]  # first_fruit will be \"üçé\"\n","last_number = numbers[-1]  # last_number will be 3\n","\n","subtuple = fruits[1:3]  # subtuple will be (\"üçå\", \"üçí\")\n","\n","fruits[0] = \"ü•≠\"  # This will cause a TypeError"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# looping through tuple\n","for fruit in fruits:\n","    print(fruit)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# comprehension\n","squares = (i**2 for i in range(10))\n","print(squares)  # generator object"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
