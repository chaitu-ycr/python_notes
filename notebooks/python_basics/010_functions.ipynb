The returned value becomes the output of the function call.\n","    - If no `return` statement is present, the function implicitly returns `None`.\n","- Using Functions Effectively\n","    - Break down complex problems into smaller, well-defined functions.\n","    - Give functions descriptive names that reflect their purpose.\n","    - Use docstrings to explain what the function does and how to use it.\n","    - Consider using default arguments to provide optional parameter values.\n","- Key Points\n","    - Functions improve code reusability by allowing you to write a block of code once and call it multiple times with different inputs.\n","    - Arguments provide flexibility in how you use a function.\n","    - Return values enable functions to provide data back to the calling code.\n","    - Docstrings enhance code readability and understanding."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def greet(name):\n","    \"\"\"This function greets a person by name.\"\"\"\n","    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n","\n","# Call the function with different names\n","greet(\"Alice\")\n","greet(\"Bob\")\n","greet(\"Charlie\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["- `def greet(name):`: This line defines the function named `greet`.
