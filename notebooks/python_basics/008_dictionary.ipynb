Unlike lists and sets, which store items in an order, dictionaries provide a flexible way to associate unique keys with their corresponding values.\n","- Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`\n","- Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, or tuples are common choices for keys).\n","- Values can be of any data type (strings, integers, lists, or even other dictionaries).\n","- You can access a value by its associated key within square brackets\n","- If the key doesn't exist, a `KeyError` is raised.\n","- Adding or Removing Elements\n","    - Dictionaries are mutable, allowing you to modify their contents after creation\n","        - `my_dict[key]` = value: Add a new key-value pair or modify an existing value for a key.\n","        - `del my_dict[key]`: Remove the key-value pair associated with a specific key.\n","- Common Dictionary Methods\n","    - `len(my_dict)`: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.\n","    - `get(key, default)`: Returns the value for a key, or a default value if the key is not found.\n","    - `keys()`: Returns a view of all the keys in the dictionary as a dictionary view object.\n","    - `values()`: Returns a view of all the values in the dictionary as a dictionary view object.\n","    - `items()`: Returns a view of all the key-value pairs in the dictionary as a dictionary view object (tuples of (key, value)).\n","    - `pop(key, default)`: Removes the key-value pair for a key and returns the value. If the key is not found, it returns the default value (if provided).\n","    - `popitem()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary.\n","- When to Use Dictionaries\n","    - Use dictionaries when you need to associate data with unique identifiers or labels.\n","    - They are well-suited for storing configuration settings, user preferences, or any data where you need to retrieve information based on a key.\n","    - Dictionaries are essential for building more complex data structures and relationships between data elements in your programs.\n","- Key Points\n","    - Dictionaries provide a flexible way to store key-value pairs.\n","    - Keys must be unique and immutable.\n","    - Values can be of any data type.\n","    - Use methods to add, remove, access elements, and iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["fruits = {\"apple\": \"red\", \"banana\": \"yellow\", \"cherry\": \"red\"}\n","\n","apple_color = fruits[\"apple\"]  # apple_color will be \"red\""]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
