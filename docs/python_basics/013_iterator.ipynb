    "\n",
    "- iterators are objects that allow you to iterate through a collection of elements one at a time.\n",
    "- They provide a way to efficiently access elements in a sequence without loading the entire collection into memory at once.\n",
    "- This is particularly useful for working with large datasets or when you only need to process elements one by one.\n",
    "- Iterable vs. Iterator\n",
    "    - An iterable is an object that can be used to create an iterator.\n",
    "    - It defines a protocol for iterating, but it's not the iterator itself.\n",
    "    - Common iterables in Python include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries (for keys), and sets.\n",
    "    - An iterator, on the other hand, is an object that implements the iterator protocol.\n",
    "    - It keeps track of the current position within the sequence and provides a way to access the next element.\n",
    "- The Iterator Protocol\n",
    "    - An iterator must implement two special methods\n",
    "        - `__iter__(self)`: This method returns the iterator object itself. It's called when you use the `iter()` function on an iterable.\n",
    "        - `__next__(self)`: This method raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements to iterate over. Otherwise, it returns the next element in the sequence.\n",
    "- You can obtain an iterator from an iterable using the built-in `iter()` function"

    "- Using Iterators in `for` Loops\n",
    "    - The for loop in Python automatically uses the iterator protocol behind the scenes.\n",
    "    - When you use a `for` loop with an iterable, Python internally creates an iterator object, calls `__next__` repeatedly to get the next element, and assigns it to the loop variable until `StopIteration` is raised."

    "- Custom Iterators\n",
    "    - You can create your own custom iterators by defining a class that implements the iterator protocol (i.e., defines the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods).\n",
    "    - This allows you to create iterators for custom data structures or generate sequences on demand.\n",
    "- Benefits of Using Iterators\n",
    "    - Memory Efficiency: Iterators process elements one at a time, reducing memory usage compared to loading the entire collection at once. This is especially beneficial for large datasets.\n",
    "    - Lazy Evaluation: Some iterators, like those created with generator expressions, can be even more memory-efficient as they generate elements only when needed.\n",
    "    - Flexibility: Iterators provide a generic way to work with different data structures that support iteration.\n",
    "- Common Use Cases\n",
    "    - Iterating over elements in lists, tuples, and strings.\n",
    "    - Processing elements in files line by line.\n",
    "    - Creating custom sequences using generator expressions or generator functions."
