The first element has index 0, the second element has index 1, and so on.\n","- You can access elements using their index within square brackets.\n","- Negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of the list. -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second-last, and so on.\n","- You can extract a portion of a list using slicing with square brackets and colons (`:`)\n","- The syntax is `[start:end:step]`\n","    - `start` (optional): Index of the first element to include (inclusive). Defaults to 0.\n","    - `end` (optional): Index of the element to exclude (exclusive). Defaults to the list length.\n","    - `step` (optional): Number of steps to take between elements. Defaults to 1 (iterates through all elements).\n","- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation.\n","- You can assign a new value to an element using its index.\n","- methods to add or remove elements from a list\n","    - `append(element)`: Add an element to the end of the list.\n","    - `insert(index, element)`: Insert an element at a specific index.\n","    - `remove(element)`: Remove the first occurrence of an element (error if not found).\n","    - `pop(index)`: Remove and return the element at a specific index (or the last element by default).\n","- Common List Operations\n","    - `len(list)`: Returns the length (number of items) in the list.\n","    - `in` and `not in`: Check if an element is present in the list.\n","    - `list.extend(iterable)`: Extends the list by appending all elements from another iterable (like another list).\n","- Key Points\n","    - Lists are versatile and can store various data types.\n","    - Indexing provides access to individual elements.\n","    - Slicing allows you to extract sublists.\n","    - Lists are mutable, enabling modification of their contents.\n","    - Various methods offer functionalities for adding, removing, and manipulating list elements."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# create list\n","fruits = [\"🍎\", \"🍌\", \"🍒\"]\n","print(fruits)       #
